A barcode reader compatible with SixLabors.ImageSharp using ZXing. Trying to get off System.Drawing.Common.

I created this library specifically to use with blazor but you can totally use this for other use cases!

## IMPORTANT
This library is depending on a pre-release of the `ZXing.Net.Bindings.ImageSharp` library. The release of this library is tagged as full-release though. I am not liable for any issues you encounter.
